# Docker Image for Atlassian JIRA 7.0.5

*this documentation isn't finally done yet - we still working on major and minor issues corresponding to this repository base!*

this repository provide the currently latest version of Atlassians agile ticketing software [jira](https://de.atlassian.com/software/jira) including the recommended [MySQL java connector](http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.tar.gz) for an easy and painless docker based jira installation. Take note, that this repository will be used inside our docker atlassian application workbench sources (also available on Github as soon as our documentation stands stable and "readable"). *In this workbench we've combine additional atlassian products (jira, jira and bitbucket) using advanced docker features like docker-compose based service management, data-container, links â€¦ etc*

## Preparation
we recommended the usage of the latest version docker and for simple system integration/supervision docker's "in-house" application docker-compose.
If you're using MacOS or Windows as host operating system, you may take the advantage of docker-machine for docker's vm management. Jira needs
a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL linked to. We'll provide a spec.
MySQL container configuration inside this documentation beside a docker-compose sample yaml config file, to show container linking feature. Use the installation guides of provided links down below to comply your docker pre-peration process.

[docker-compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)</br>

## Installation-Method 1, docker direct mode
as long as our image isn't available via docker.io hub repository, you've to build it by yourself using this github repository. this steps will show you the generic, pure docker based installation of our jira image container, without any database container linked or data-container feature.  *We also will provide a docker-compose based installation in this documentation*.

1. checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-jira.git .
```

2. build jira (version 7.0.5) image on your local docker host, naming image "df/jira:7.0.5"

```bash
docker build -t df/jira:7.0.5
```

3. start your new jira application container

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 df/jira 
```
	
4. finish your installation using atlassian's browser based configuration 
just navigate to `http://[dockerhost]:8080` 


## Installation-Method 2, docker-compose (simple)
this steps will show you an alternative way of jira service container installation using docker-compose

1. checkout this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dunkelfrosch/docker-jira.git .
```

2. create a docker-compose.yml file in your target directory (or using the existing one), insert the following lines (docker-compose.yml in ./sample-configs/ directory).

3. start your jira container by docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d jira
```

4. (optional) rename the resulting image after successful build (we'll use our image auto-name result here)
```bash
docker tag dfdockerjira_jira df/jira:7.0.5
```
5. the result should by a running container and an available local jira image

## Installation-Method 3, docker-compose (using db)
jira needs a relational db and may feel more self-confident using data-only container features. Take a look inside your *./sample-config* path, we've provide a few sample docker-compose yaml config files to show you those feature implementations.

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-dc.yml**
> sample configuration for data-container feature

./sample-configs/**docker-compose-linkdb.yml**
> sample configuration for linking mysql container directly

## container access and maintenance
you can check container health by accessing logs of inner tomcat/jira processes directly as long as the container is still running. as you can see in this screenshot, atlassian jira was starting successfully (*we've to ignore some by-side warnings ;)* )

```bash
docker logs df-atls-jira
```

you can login easily to your running jira container to take a deeper look in your jira service process. *this jira build provide midnight-commander as terminal extension accessable typing "mc" in your container session shell*.

```bash
docker exec -it --user root df-atls-jira /bin/bash
```
