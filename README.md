# Docker Image for Atlassian JIRA 7.0.5

*this documentation isn't finally done yet - we still working on major and minor issues corresponding to this repository base!*

this repository provide the currently latest version of Atlassians version control software [jira server](https://de.atlassian.com/software/jira) including the recommended [MySQL java connector](http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.tar.gz) for an easy and painless docker based jira installation. Take note, that this repository will be used inside our docker atlassian application workbench sources (also available on Github as soon as our documentation stands stable and "readable"). *In this workbench we've combine additional atlassian products (jira, confluence and jira) using advanced docker features like docker-compose based service management, data-container, links* â€¦

## Preparation
we recommended the usage of the latest version docker and for simple system integration/supervision docker's "in-house" application docker-compose.
If you're using MacOS or Windows as host operating system, you may take the advantage of docker-machine for docker's vm management. Bitbucket needs
a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL linked to. We'll provide a spec.
MySQL container configuration inside this documentation beside a docker-compose sample yaml config file, to show container linking feature. Use the installation guides of provided links down below to comply your docker pre-peration process.

[docker-compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)</br>
[docker machine installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/)</br>

## Installation, Method 1
this steps will show you the generic, pure docker based installation of our jira image container, without any database container linked or data-container feature.  *We also will provide a docker-compose based installation in this documentation*.

1. checkout this repository

2. build jira (version 7.0.5) image on your local docker host

```bash
docker build -t df/jira:7.0.5
```

3. start your new jira application container

```bash
docker run -d -p 7990:7990 df/jira 
```
	
4. finish your installation using atlassian's browser based configuration
